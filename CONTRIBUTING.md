# How to Contribute

The marketing website for Commit is 100% open source! Below you'll find some information about how to contribute to this project. We're still figuring out how to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, but hopefully this documentation clears up some questions you might have. If something isn't clear or is missing, let us know (or even better, submit a PR ðŸ˜‰)!

## What to Work On

The coordination of work being done (and to be done) will happen via [Issues in this repository](https://github.com/commitdev/commit.dev/issues). If you're looking for something to work on, this is the place to check.

> ### Working on the new marketing site?
>
> While the new site is being developed, we'd like to prevent releasing it onto the commit.dev domain. To do this, we have created a new branch called [`launch`](https://github.com/commitdev/commit.dev/tree/launch) that we are treating as the main branch. Here we will stage all the changes and then, once it is ready to release, we will merge this branch into the main branch.
>
> This means that if you're working on changes for the new marketing site, please create your working branches off of this branch and ensure PRs that you create are against this `launch` branch rather than the current `main` branch. You can adjust this when creating the PR by selecting the `launch` branch as the base.

## Proposing a Change

If you're fixing a bug, feel free to submit a pull request right away with enough detail around what the bug was. If you've got an idea or something you'd like to change, please submit an issue outlining what it is you'd like to do. This will enable people more familiar with this project to help review this idea, ensure it doesn't conflict with other work, and hash-out any nuances with you, ultimately helping us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant effort into it. We're always open to new ideas and suggestions, so please don't be shy if you have an idea.

## Style Guide

We use an automatic code formatter called [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and a linter to help catch most issues that may exist in your code. There are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up though. If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction.

## Submitting a Pull Request

We monitor all pull requests submitted to this repository. Once a pull request is submitted, we will review it and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. We'll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.

When you create a pull request, please fill in the information we ask for in the template (you'll see it when creating the pull request). This information will help us review your pull request faster. If information we feel is needed is missing, we will ask for it in the pull request. If there is other information that you feel is relevant but we don't explicitly ask for it, please feel free to add it into the description of the pull request.

## How to Get in Touch

We will monitor [Issues in this repository](https://github.com/commitdev/commit.dev/issues), so if you have something you'd like to discuss that is a good place to do so. If you are a member of the Commit community and have access to our Slack channels, we can also be reached via the [#commit-dot-dev](https://commitdev.slack.com/archives/C01KCTT03PS) Slack channel.
